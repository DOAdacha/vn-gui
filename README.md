# vn-gui

2/12/15-
vnGUI - tried to add a JPanel that allowed for overlaps, could not confirm if it does allow or not
mob - created, no real code added to it
skills - create and instantiated all variables that could be thought of that are needed, added accessors (create a variable for animations at a later date)
