# vn-gui

2/12/15-
vnGUI - tried to add a JPanel that allowed for overlaps, could not confirm if it does allow or not
mob - created, no real code added to it
skills - create and instantiated all variables that could be thought of that are needed, added accessors (create a variable for animations at a later date)

2/23/15
added code to skills and mob including accessors, private member variables, and mutators.
skills needs to have the buff itterations moved to a future character/mob class
feels strange to hold the buff itterations inside of the skills class
added itterations of an attribute data type, removed old String usage of attributes
attributes are now included with factors against weaknesses and strengths and have a small circle in which they interact
